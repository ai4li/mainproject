# AI4LI (AI for Life Inclusion)

**AI4LI (AI for Life Inclusion)** is a project focused on developing tools and software powered by artificial intelligence to support people with disabilities in fully participating in life.

## Project Vision

**AI4LI** aims to research and develop technological solutions, tools, and software to support augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). These solutions are designed to run on smartphones, smart devices, and computers, enabling everyoneâ€”regardless of their abilities, circumstances, or characteristicsâ€”to participate fully in all aspects of life, including daily activities, work, education, and entertainment.

## Core Technologies

AI4LI focuses on developing AI applications that support people with disabilities through the following core technologies:

- ### ðŸ¤– Computer Vision  
  Enables the recognition and classification of images from the surrounding environment to support people who are blind or deaf in daily activities, learning, and work.

- ### ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
  Analyzes and processes natural language, including text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion, supporting communication for people with hearing impairments or reading difficulties.

- ### ðŸ”Š Speech Processing  
  Recognizes speech and converts text into speech, enabling more effective communication for people with disabilities in their everyday lives.
